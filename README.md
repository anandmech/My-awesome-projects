# My-awesome-projects

Here is a portfolio of my current capstone projects for Thinkful data science certification program:-

- Supervised Capstone: Predicting Telecom Churn for IBM Watson Analytics Dataset - Carried out Data Visualization, Feature Engineering, built predictive models using Supervised Learning methods to predict customers most vulnerable to churn.

	- Program/Library Used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decsion Trees, K-Nearest neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression


- Unsupervised Learning: Clustering Boston marathon data - Applied clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques using Unsupervised Learning methods to visualize, group similar observations, and gain valuable insights from Boston marathon data.

	- Program/Library Used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, K-means clustering, Gaussian mixture, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) dimensionality reduction methods
