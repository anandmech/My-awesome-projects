# My-awesome-projects

Here is a portfolio of my capstone projects for Thinkful data science certification program:-

- Supervised Capstone: Predicting Telecom Churn for IBM Watson Analytics Dataset - Carried out Data Visualization, Feature Engineering, built predictive models using Supervised Learning methods to predict customers most vulnerable to churn.

	- Program/Library Used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, K-Nearest neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression


- Unsupervised Capstone: Clustering NJ Transit + Amtrak (NEC) Rail Performance Dataset - Carried out out Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), applied clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques using Unsupervised Learning methods to visualize, group similar observations, and gain valuable insights from the data.The purpose is to segment train lines and better inform riders in advance of potential delays and cancellations using machine learning algorithms. 

	- Program/Library Used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, K-means clustering, DBSCAN clustering, GMM clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) dimensionality reduction methods


- Unsupervised Learning: Clustering Boston marathon data - Applied clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques using Unsupervised Learning methods to visualize, group similar observations according to gender and age groups, and gain valuable insights from Boston marathon data.

	- Program/Library Used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, K-means clustering, GMM clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) dimensionality reduction methods


- Time Series Analysis: US GDP data 1990-2020 from FRED's website - Went about the process of time series modeling to visualize and gain valuable insights from US GDP data.
